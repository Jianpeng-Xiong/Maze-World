# Maze-World

The Maze World is a practical training project for my data structure course during my sophomore year of university, and also my first major project during my undergraduate studies. 
It is based on the C language and involves related knowledge points such as linked lists, files, graphs, etc. This is a great project, completed jointly by me and my roommates Luo_zhongtian and Fu_siyang. 
 We ultimately achieved first place in this course with a score close to full marks. The main presentation here is the PDF version of the PPT, as the code is on the previous faulty laptop. 
 It seems to have passed away with youth, haha. Hope it's helpful to you.
