# Maze-World

The Maze World is a practical training project for my data structure course during my sophomore year of university, and also my first major project during my undergraduate studies. 
It is based on the C language and involves related knowledge points such as linked lists, files, graphs, etc. This is a great project, completed jointly by me and my roommates Luo_zhongtian and Fu_siyang. 
The main presentation here is the PDF version of the PPT, as the code seems to be missing haha. Hope it's helpful to you.
